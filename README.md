# Front-end for a simple TON contract

Written in Vite + Vue on TypeScript and published on GitHub pages (automatically via workflows).

The contract (in FunC) with its tests is [developed separately](https://github.com/unserialize/my_blackhole_contract), it's just a front-end demonstration.

The contract (in testnet) can be viewed [here](https://testnet.tonscan.org/address/EQD4Nu_attpQdAHKaSOKSUwAfpJUrXIstF5yGqZvYr-RJT6e).

You can connect your wallet, invoke getters, and send some transactions.
